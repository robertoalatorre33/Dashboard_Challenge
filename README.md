# Dashboard_Challenge


**Inspirational Questions:** Here are some open-ended questions that you can explore and try to address through creating visualizations, or R or Python analyses.

* What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
* What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
* Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?
* Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
* Is there a relationship between age and performance?
* Does working on special projects affects performance?
* Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
